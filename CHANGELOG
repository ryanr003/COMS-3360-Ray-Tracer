# Ray Tracer Changelog (By: Ryan Riebesehl)

## September 16 (Start) - Present Push (Oct. 6th)

### Week 1: September 16-22

- Added ray-sphere intersection with UV coordinate generation
- Created basic rendering loop with PPM output and background gradient
- Implemented anti-aliasing (100 samples per pixel) with correction
- Started material system with diffuse material

### Week 2: September 23-29
**Materials and Geometry**
- Completed material system: Metal (specular), Dielectric (glass with Fresnel), and Emissive (lights)
- Implemented ray-triangle intersection
- Created OBJ mesh loader supporting vertex positions and face triangulation
- Started acceleration structure with AABB class

### Week 3: September 30 - October 6
**Acceleration**
- Implemented BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) with recursive construction
- Added texture system framework with solid color and checker textures
- Built demonstration scene with glass bubble, sparkles, and lights
- Created Makefile with optimization flags/warnings
